# PKG Build Process
    
pkg has so called "base binaries" - they are actually same node executables but with some patches applied. They are used as a base for every executable pkg creates. pkg downloads precompiled base binaries before packaging your application.

When package a project, pkg will try to get the node binaries from below locations:
1. PKG local cache folder, the default location is `%userprofile%/.pkg-cache`, can use `PKG_CACHE_PATH` environment variable to specify a custom path  
2. If not found the local cache, pkg-fetch will try to retrieve from [remote path](https://github.com/vercel/pkg-fetch/releases)  
3. If not found in remote, will download source code from node.js official and compile it. The compile result will be saved to pkg local cache folder.  


Due to limited resource, PKG now only supports node 64 bit. When package a 32 bit node project, we need to compile 32bit node and patch it by ourselves. Below sections demo the whole process.  
# Compile Node and Node Patch

VisualStudio 2022 does not support 32 bit OS anymore, so we need to setup node build environment in 64 bit OS, both client and server OS should be fine.  

All below sub sections are done on Windows Server 2022 64 bit machine. This is also the official Node binary build platform mentioned in [official-binary-platforms](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v22.11.0/BUILDING.md#official-binary-platforms-and-toolchains)

## Setup Node build Environment
Follow node official guide [BUILDING.md](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v22.11.0/BUILDING.md#windows) to setup build environment.   
Be attention the official guide may change based on the node tag version you select. 

## Create Nodejs Patch(Optional)
**Note 2024-11-04:**  
@yao-pkg/pkg-fetch already provided the patch file of node v22.11.0. The patch files are available at [patches](https://github.com/yao-pkg/pkg-fetch/tree/main/patches). So we can use this official patch directly.   
This section is preserved and should only be used when there is no official patch available.    

[pkg-fetch](https://github.com/vercel/pkg-fetch#contributing-updates-to-patches) has a guide on how to create a node patch.

1. Clone Node.js as a sibling to your current pkg-fetch clone

        mkdir C:\git
        cd c:\git
        git clone https://github.com/yao-pkg/pkg-fetch.git   // clone pkg-fetch
        git clone https://github.com/nodejs/node.git           // clone node
        cd node
  
2. Checkout the tag you wish to generate a patch for. 

        git checkout v22.11.0
  
3. Attempt to apply the closest patch (e.g. applying the existing patch for 18.15.0 when trying to generate a new patch for 18.14.0)

        git apply ..\pkg-fetch\patches\node.v22.11.0.cpp.patch --reject

4. If no rejects, great! you are ready to make your new patch file  

        git add -A
        git diff --staged --src-prefix=node/ --dst-prefix=node/ > ..\pkg-fetch\patches\node.v22.11.0_new.cpp.patch

5. If rejects exist, search all `*.rej`, and  resolve them yourself, and ensure all changes are saved, and repeat step 4 to export the patch file

### Attention

1. Make sure the encoding of generated patch file is `UTF-8`.
2. Uses the `git apply --check node.v18.14.0.cpp.patch` on a clean node v18.14.0 branch to ensure the patch file is valid.

### How to resolve the rejection

All need to do is to manually merge the change from `src/xxx.cc.rej` into `src/xxx.cc` and remove the `*.rej` file.  
After resolve all files, please repeat step 4 to export the patch file.

## Build Node with patch 
1. Download node v20.18.0 x64 binaries from https://nodejs.org/dist/v20.18.0/, unzip to `C:\git\node-v20.18.0-win-x64`. Set windows environment, add node location to global path, so we can recognize node and npm in cmd.   

    Note: The version `20.18.0` looks weird but quite important to the nodejs building in the following steps. When I used node v22.11.0, there are lots of unknown errors during compiling. I saw @yao-pkg/pkg-fetch use node v20 to setup environment(see [Dockerfile.linux](https://github.com/yao-pkg/pkg-fetch/blob/main/Dockerfile.linux)), that maybe the reason.  
I got this tip from [here](https://github.com/Infern1/pkg-fetch/actions/runs/11596218485/job/32286742574)  

2. clone pkg-fetch:  

        git clone https://github.com/yao-pkg/pkg-fetch.git  

3. Goto pkg-fetch folder, install yarn globally.

        npm install -g yarn

4. Install prerequisite node_modules

        yarn install --ignore-engines

5. Goto patches folder, make sure you have got the correct patch file for the node version you want to build. And confirm the config in `patches.json` is correct. Config file should record the correct node version and patch file.  

6. Run below command to compile node. It will take a long time to complete.   

        yarn start --node-range node22 --arch x86 --output dist

    Note: When specify node-range as node22, pkg-fetch will first search under patches folder to find node 22 patch, then use this node version to download and compile the node source code. So the node version in `patches.json` is very very important.   
7. After compile complete, the node v22 is ready at dist folder, filename like this `node-v22.11.0-win-x86`. Rename it to `built-v22.11.0-win-x86` and  `built-v22.11.0-win-x86.sha256sum`
8. copy files `built-v22.11.0-win-x86` and  `built-v22.11.0-win-x86.sha256sum` to `c:\git\output\pkg\.pkg-cache\v3.5`   
9. Copy `c:\git\output` to a file server for later use.

That's all we need to do on node build machine

# Download pkg source code
On our develop machine  

There is an example project under pkg source code, which is written using express. We would use this project to demo how to use pkg to package node 32 bit project files to a single executable application.  We can also use this project to verify if our final build environment is correct.  

    mkdir C:\git\pkg\demo
    cd C:\git\pkg\demo
    git clone https://github.com/yao-pkg/pkg.git

the example project is under `C:\git\pkg\demo\pkg\examples\express`  
Add pkg as dev dependency:  

    cd C:\git\pkg\demo\pkg\examples\express
    npm install @yao-pkg/pkg --save-dev
    node index.js

Open web browser, input url `http://localhost:8080/`, should show `Hello, world!`  
# Package our demo project
1. Copy the output folder generated on 32 bit machine to develop machine `C:\git\pkg\demo\output`   
2. Set PKG cache path

        cd C:\git\pkg\demo\pkg\examples\express
        set PKG_CACHE_PATH=C:\git\pkg\demo\output\pkg\.pkg-cache

3. (optional, required if we have self-built patch) Copy pkg-fetch patch file from `C:\git\demo\output\pkg-fetch\patches` to `C:\git\demo\pkg\examples\express\node_modules\pkg-fetch\patches`  
4. Run below command to generate exe

        cd C:\git\pkg\demo\pkg\examples\express
        node .\node_modules\@yao-pkg\pkg\lib-es5\bin.js . -t node22-win-x86 -o .\output\test.exe --debug > debug.log

   PKG should not download and compile Node anymore. There should be an exe generated under `C:\git\pkg\demo\pkg\examples\express\output`  
   Check debug.log, the log should end like below  

        > [debug] Targets:
        [
        {
          "nodeRange": "node22",
          "platform": "win",
          "arch": "x86",
          "output": "xxx",
          "forceBuild": false,
          "fabricator": {
            "nodeRange": "node22",
            "platform": "win",
            "arch": "x86",
            "binaryPath": "xxx"
          },
          "binaryPath": "xxxx"
        }
        ]

    If the log end with any error or fail, should check and fix it.

5. Double click to run test.exe   
   Open web browser, input url `http://localhost:8080/`, should show `Hello, world!`  

# Notes

## Location
npm global install location:  
If you installed node or npm by installer, the npm module global install path should be `%userProfile%\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules`.    
If you download node binaries and set node path in system environment, the npm module global path should be `<your node path>\node_modules`

## Pkg debug

Add debug information during pkg build package  

        node .\node_modules\pkg\lib-es5\bin.js . -t node18-win-x86 -o .\output\test.exe --debug

Output the file list

        SET DEBUG_PKG=1
        test.exe > fileList.log


#  Missing SafeSEH
There is a DFS issue found, the exe we built is missing SafeSEH.   
This issue only occurs in x86 exe, 64 bit exe does not have this flag.  
When do packaging, PKG appends our source files at the end of node.exe, then unzip it when execute. So what we need to do is to add SafeSEH flag for node.exe.    
As pkg does not provide 32 bit node, we have to build our own 32 bit node. Detail please refer section [Build Node with patch](#build-node-with-patch).   
The workflow is:
1. Pkg-fetch check if there is available node22 source code. If no, it will download from node official. Cache path is: `%userprofile%\.pkg-cache\node` 
2. After download complete, unzip it to temp folder `%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Temp\pkg.xxxxxx\node`
3. Call node commands to compile node projects  
        i. Use .gyp file to generate vc project and solution files  
        ii.Use MSBuild to compile node projects
4. After compile complete, zip node.exe, output it to `pkg-fetch\dist`    

What we need to do is to modify the vcxproj file generated in step 3.i. Add `/SafeSeh` flag for node project.     

## Modify vcxproj
Note: Below is not the final solution steps. I add this section to record my investigate process. It will be useful if we upgrade node to a higher version in the future.  

1. clone node source code 

        git clone https://github.com/nodejs/node.git           
2. Checkout the tag .

        git checkout v22.11.0

3. Run cmd with below command to generate project files only

        vcbuild.bat x86 projgen nobuild

4. Open node.sln with VS, open the property setting of node project, in Linker - Advanced, change `Image Has Safe Exception Handlers` as `Yes (/SAFESEH)`.  
    ![img](https://github.com/kerwenzhang/kerwenzhang.github.io/blob/master/_posts/image/safeimage1.png?raw=true) 

5. Build node project, there are errors popup

        60>v8_base_without_compiler.lib(push_registers_masm.obj) : error LNK2026: module unsafe for SAFESEH image.
        60>v8_snapshot.lib(embedded.obj) : error LNK2026: module unsafe for SAFESEH image.
        60>out\Debug\node.exe : fatal error LNK1281: Unable to generate SAFESEH image.

6. There are two libraries are unsafe for SAFESEH image: `v8_base_without_compiler` and `v8_snapshot`.   
Take `v8_base_without_compiler` as example, this project includes a MASM file which is unsafe.   
   ![img](https://github.com/kerwenzhang/kerwenzhang.github.io/blob/master/_posts/image/safeimage2.png?raw=true)   
To fix this issue, in node solution, goto `(tools) - (v8_gypfiles)`, find `v8_base_without_compiler` project, right click to open property setting, in `        Microsoft Macro Assembler - Advanced`, change `Use Safe Exception Handlers` as `Yes (/safeseh)`.      

    ![img](https://github.com/kerwenzhang/kerwenzhang.github.io/blob/master/_posts/image/safeimage3.png?raw=true)     
Same change for `v8_snapshot` project.  

7. After change these setting, recompile node project. If compile succeed, we are ready to goto next section.  

## Modify gyp file
Mentioned in [section](#anomaly-cvbbatch-2335-missing-safeseh)3.i, the node vcxproj files are auto generated. Node uses gyp to generate these project files. What we need to do is to modify the gyp file, add additional msvc setting, so the vcxproj generated will contain the `safeseh` setting we want.   

1. In node root folder, find node.gyp, search `ImageHasSafeExceptionHandlers`, you should find only one result:  

        # Relevant only for x86.
        # Refs: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/25852
        # Refs: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/safeseh-image-has-safe-exception-handlers
        'msvs_settings': {
          'VCLinkerTool': {
                'ImageHasSafeExceptionHandlers': 'false',
          },
        },

    change default `false` to `true`. There are two links in comments you can refer.  

2. In tools\v8_gypfiles folder, find v8.gyp. Use `'target_name': 'v8_base_without_compiler'`as key word to find `v8_base_without_compiler` , add msvc setting under it. This project doesn't have default SafeImage setting.  

        'msvs_settings': {
            'MASM': {
              'UseSafeExceptionHandlers': 'true',
            },
          },

    Same change for `v8_snapshot`. It is in v8.gyp too.

3. After modifying gyp file, run command to regenerate vcxproject file, make sure they are correct.  

        vcbuild.bat x86 projgen nobuild

## Generate patch file
Above two sections happens in node repo, what we need to do now is to reproduce our changes in pkg-fetch. pkg-fetch will auto download node source and compile it. To insert our changes, we need to generate a new patch for node and merge our patch into pkg-fetch's.  

1. In node repo root folder, run below command:  

        git add -A
        git diff --staged --src-prefix=node/ --dst-prefix=node/ > ..\node.v22.11.0_safeImage.cpp.patch

2. Open patch file, make sure only `node.gyp` and `v8.gyp` are changed. Copy all contents of our patch.   

3. Goto pkg-fetch\patches, find node.v22.11.0.cpp.patch, paste our patch at the end.

4. Follow section [Build Node with patch](#build-node-with-patch) step 6, run command

        yarn start --node-range node22 --arch x86 --output dist

You should be able to get a x86 node with safeSEH enabled.  

## Check SafeSEH flag
We can use a powershell script to check if safeSEH is enabled.  
1. clone repo PESecurity:  

        git clone https://github.com/NetSPI/PESecurity

2. open a powershell window and import this module:  

        cd C:\git\PESecurity
        Import-Module .\Get-PESecurity.psm1

3. Check file PE property:

        Get-PESecurity -file "C:\git\pkg-fetch\dist\node-v22.11.0-win-x86"
        Get-PESecurity -directory C:\Windows\System32\
