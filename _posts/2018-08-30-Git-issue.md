GitLab download code时遇到以下错误提示：  

	Cloning into 'project_name'...
	remote: HTTP Basic: Access denied
	fatal: Authentication failed for 'http://my_user_name@example.com/my_user_name/project_name.git/'
	
解决方案：  

Apply command from cmd with Administrator  

git config --system --unset credential.helper

And when i execute above command i got another error

	error: could not lock config file C:\Program Files\Git\mingw64/etc/gitconfig: Permission denied

And then i removed gitconfig file from C:\Program Files\Git\mingw64/etc/ location

After that use git command like git pull or git push, it asked me for username and password. applying valid username and password and git command working.
